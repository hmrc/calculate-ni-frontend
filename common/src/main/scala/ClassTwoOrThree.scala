/**
  * Class 2 contributions are a flat rate weekly liability payable by
  * all self-employed people over 16 (up to State Pension age) with
  * profits above the Small Profits Threshold. Self-employed people
  * with profits below the Small Profits Threshold may pay Class 2
  * contributions voluntary. Voluntary payments of Class 2 NICs are
  * typically collected through self-assessment but can usually be
  * paid up to six years after the tax year.  Class 4 NICs may also
  * have to be paid by the self-employed if their profits for the year
  * are over the lower profits limit (see below).
  *
  * Class 3 NICs may be paid voluntarily by people aged 16 and over
  * (but below State Pension age) to help them qualify for State
  * Pension if their contribution record would not otherwise be
  * sufficient.  Contributions are flat rate and can be paid up to six
  * years after the year in which they are due.
