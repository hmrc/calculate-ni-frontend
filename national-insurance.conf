# This configuration file is in HOCON format, for the details please refer here -
# https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md

# In addition to the standard HOCON datatypes intervals are supported -
# [a,b] means 'from a to b inclusive'
# (a,b) means 'from a to b, non-inclusive'
# [0,5) for example, means any number from (and including) 0 to 5 but not 5 (4.9999 would be in the range).

# intervals are used when talking about tax years -
# '1975' is just shorthand for '[1975-04-06,1976-04-05]'

# or when talking about money -
# "[56.33,411.67)" means 'from £56.33 up to but not including £411.67'

# tax rates can be expressed as percentages
# 1.2% is equivalent to 0.012
